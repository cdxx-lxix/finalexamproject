                        <strong>Extensions | </strong> It's modern age of the Internet today and we all use at least one extension some of them modifying webpages. Disconnect, uBlock, adBlock and similar may cause troubles. You can safely
                        disable it\them here. There is no cookies or ads.<br>
                        <strong>Browsers | </strong> The sad truth is that we have lots of browsers today but under the hood it's just webkit. This website is optimised for chromium(webkit) browsers despite the fact of me being a fellow Mozilla user ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ . <br>
                        <strong>Connection | </strong> Yeah, it's 2021 and we can still have connection problems. Check it. <br>
                        <strong>Strict mode | </strong> Some browsers have "Strict mode" which block some website functionality. Look for a shield icon near address bar or search in settings. <br>

                        <strong>Sign In | </strong> First of all check your current language, caps-lock, num-lock. If it doesn't work then use "Forgot my password" button. If it doesn't work too, contact me directly using contact form on "About" page. <br>
                        <strong>Sign Up | </strong> I've got plenty of error messages on this site and if some of them occurring during registration multiple times contact me directly using contact form on "About" page. <br>
                        <strong>Sign Out | </strong> Most likely session was interrupted or your browser failed to process my termination request. Try reloading page and\or close then open it again to Log out. If it doesn't work, you know where to contact me. <br>
                        <strong>Password recovery | </strong> Didn't receive password recovery link? Well, check your "SPAM" folder \ email address for typos or try different email (we are all humans and you could just forget what address did you use).

                        <strong>Avatar | </strong> This maybe caused most likely by image itself. Check its type, not the extension (it means nothing). If it's correct try different image and in case it's working we can assume that the first image is corrupt.
                        The second reason is of course my database problems but all you can do about it, is let me know. <br>
                        <strong>Password change | </strong> It's either your spelling or database problems nothing to help here.
